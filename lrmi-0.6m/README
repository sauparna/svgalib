vbetest - show available modes, and test a mode

mode3 - set mode using vesa bios. It can usually restore text mode after
        svgalib leaves a non-working text-mode.

vga_reset - call real mode c000:0003, which should be the video card's
	initialization routine. Should work in some cases when mode3 fails to
	restore text mode.
