This is a modified version of lrmi-0.9 package.
The original is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lrmi


Programs included are:

vbetest - show available modes, and test a mode.

vbegetmodeinfo - show information about a vbe mode.

mode3 - set mode using vesa bios. It can usually restore text mode after
        svgalib leaves a non-working text-mode.

vga_reset - call real mode c000:0003, which should be the video card's
	initialization routine. Should work in some cases when mode3 fails to
	restore text mode.

get-edid - Use vbe call to get monitor's edid information.
