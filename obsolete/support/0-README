This contains the source for a Borland C++ program that allows you to dump
the register contents for any BIOS video mode. 'vga.exe' should work with
any VGA/SVGA adapter. It takes a hexadecimal mode number as argument and
writes the (VGA) register contents to the console.

These printout can be used to write a new driver. Please read also 'man 7 
svgalib.et4000' about the tseng3.exe program.

trap-out.asm / .com is a DOS program which traces all I/O calls made when a
given video mode is set by the BIOS. It was used for the TVGA driver and should
be useful for other drivers too, esp. if no documentation is available.

It spits out a long list of "T DX/I AX/L" strings where T is "I" for IN or
"O" for OUT, DX/I is the value of DX or the immediate given value for
ports <256, and AX/L is the value of AX or AL before the call to IN or OUT
(yeah, the value of AX is pretty worthless before a call to IN, but oh
well)

This output is very very easily parsed into a simple C routine that calls
port_in and port_out many many times, but will set the same mode the BIOS
did.
