.SH NAME
gl_compileboxmask \- compress a masked bitmap

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <vgagl.h>

.BI "void gl_compileboxmask(int " w ", int " h ", void *" sdp ", void *" ddp );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert the rectangular masked bitmap of size
.RI ( w ", " h ") at " sdp
to a compressed format that allows faster drawing, which is
stored at
.IR ddp .
Allocating
.IR w " * " h
bytes for the compiled
version is usually enough; an upper limit should be 
.RI ( w " + 2) * " h .

Compiled bitmaps are only supported in linear 256 color modes.
