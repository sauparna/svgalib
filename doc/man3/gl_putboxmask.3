.SH NAME
gl_putboxmask \- copy a masked  pixmap to a rectangular area

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <vgagl.h>

.BI "void gl_putboxmask(int " x ", int " y ", int " w ", int " h ", void *" dp );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy the contents of a memory buffer
.I dp
to a rectangular bitmap at position
.RI ( x ", " y )
with size
.RI ( w ", " h ).

This function works like
.BR gl_putbox ,
but does not write pixmap pixels of color zero. If the same pixmap is used often
you should consider using the faster
.BR gl_putboxmaskcompiled (3).

Pixmaps are in row-major order. The source pixmap memory has the size
.IR w " * " h " * "
.BR BYTESPERPIXEL .
