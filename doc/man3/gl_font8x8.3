.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <vgagl.h>

.BI "extern unsigned char *" gl_font8x8 ;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gl_font8x8
contains a packed pixel font with 8x8 pixels per character which you can
use in your
.B vgagl
programs. Before you can use it, you might need to expand it with
.BR gl_expandfont (3),
though.

It is possible to use non expanded fonts (but it is slower) when
the
.BR "FONT_COMPRESSED gl_setwritemode" (3)
flag is set.
