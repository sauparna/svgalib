.TH gl_trisetdrawpoint 3 "2 Aug 1997" "Svgalib (>= 1.2.11)" "Svgalib User Manual"
.SH NAME
gl_trisetdrawpoint \- set a triangle drawing function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <triangle.h>

.BI "void gl_trisetdrawpoint(void (" setpixelfunc ") (int " x ", int " y ", int " color ") );

.SH DESCRIPTION
If this function is called with
.I setpixelfunc
non-zero, then the function
.I setpixelfunc
is used from
there after to draw each pixel (instead of the usual
direct screen buffer writes).

This function need never
be used, except if you want to use your own pixel
drawing function for extra effects. If you use
this feature, you can be assured that none of the
triangle routines will access the hardware,
enabling portability to other environments.

Beware, these functions are not a direct part of the svgalib library.
Instead their source is part of svgalib and can be found in the
.I threeDkit/
subdirectory of the original svgalib distribution. However, it is not
installed in the system by default, s.t. it is unclear where you can find it
if your svgalib was installed by some
linux distribution.

In case of any such problem, simply get an svgalib distribution from the net. Yo
don't need to install it. Just
.B make
in the
.I threeDkit/
subdirectory. As of this writing,
.I svgalib-1.2.12.tar.gz
is the latest version and can be retrieved by ftp from
.IR "sunsite.unc.edu" " at " "/pub/Linux/libs/graphics"
and
.IR "tsx-11.mit.edu" " at " "/pub/linux/sources/libs"
which will most probably be mirrored by a site close to you.

The functions are defined in the
.IR tri.o " and " triangl.o

The functions are defined in the
.IR tri.o " and " triangl.o
files (or their resp. sources) which you must link to your program.
