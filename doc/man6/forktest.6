.TH forktest 6 "8 April 1998" "Svgalib 1.3.0" "Svgalib User Manual"
.SH NAME
forktest \- tests the vga_safety_fork() function.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B forktest

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a copy of the
.BR keytest (6)
demo (look there). However, it uses
.BR vga_safety_fork (3)
to start a background process to restore the
console in case the fore ground process crashes. It removes all
automatic restore functions of svgalib. Thus, in case you kill
this program with
.BR kill (1)
or
.BR <Ctrl>-C ,
only the background process will
save your system from being hosed up.

You can set a videomode
to use by setting the environment variable
.B SVGALIB_DEFAULT_MODE
to a number (see vgatest
for a list) or a string like G0x1x2 where you replace 0 with desired x
resolution, 1 with the desired y rez, and 2 with the desired number of
colors (2, 16, 256, 32K, 64K, 16M, 16M4). Again, only certain choices are
available, see vgatest for a list.

In case nothing is selected, G320x200x256 is choosen.

This demo is part of svgalib and can be found in the
.I demos/
subdirectory of the original svgalib distribution. However, it is not installed in the system
by default, s.t. it is unclear where you can find it if your svgalib was installed by some
linux distribution. Even then, when you have the demo on your system, you probably won't have
the sources s.t. it is only of limited use for you.

In case of any such problem, simply get an svgalib distribution from the net. You even
don't need to install it. Just
.B make
in the
.I demos/
subdirecty. As of this writing,
.I svgalib-1.2.12.tar.gz is the latest version and can be retrieved by ftp from
.IR "sunsite.unc.edu" " at " "/pub/Linux/libs/graphics"
and
.IR "tsx-11.mit.edu" " at " "/pub/linux/sources/libs"
which will most probably be mirrored by a site close to you.
