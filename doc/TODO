Be sure to read the svgalib.FAQ man 7 svgalib.faq

Have to decide what exactly is G320x200x256 (VGA Mode 13h or SVGA
packed-pixel).  A separate Mode X would be nice too.

A set of functions to handle page-flipping would be nice. (e.g. a
vga_setvideopage() that returns the new video start address)

Support for more chipsets?

Clean up keyword parsing code.

Kernel support for page-flipping.

automatic console restore on device close.

really reliable vc switching.

There are races in the mouse code when the mouse device is closed in the
signal handler on a vc switch. Again, probably kernel support is due.

start marking functions that will become obsolete.

Move away from hard-coded mode numbers:

	Think what would happen if a program is compiled to call
	vga_setmode(G1280x1024x256) and we change the mode number to
	something else...  This has happened before.  The solution is either
	to provide a getmodenum(xres, yres, colordepth, layout) function, or
	a setmode(xres, yres, colordepth, layout) function or vow not to
	change the definitions of the mode numbers (i.e. new modes can only
	be added to the end of the list).

More RamDAC support.  The S3 code should have no problem with 868, Trio and
9xx chips except that boards that uses those chips usually uses
newer/unsupported RamDACs as well.

Multiple-adaptor support.

IBM RGB52x >8bpp support.
